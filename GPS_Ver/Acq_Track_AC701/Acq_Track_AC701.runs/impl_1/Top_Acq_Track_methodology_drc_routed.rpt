2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-190#1 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDCE cell dbg_hub/inst/CORE_XSDB.UUT_MASTER/U_ICON_INTERFACE/U_CMD5/shift_reg_in_reg[2] in site SLICE_X34Y214 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDCE cell dbg_hub/inst/CORE_XSDB.UUT_MASTER/U_ICON_INTERFACE/U_CMD5/shift_reg_in_reg[1] is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance Acq_MOD/prn_offset_reg_rep, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on FinalOut relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-21#1 Advisory
MMCME3 with ZHOLD does not drive sequential IO  
The MMCME3 cell CLOCK_NETWORK/inst/mmcme3_adv_inst has COMPENSATION value ZHOLD, but CLKOUT0 output does not drive any sequential IO cells. It is recommended to use the MMCM without a feedback buffer and set COMPENSATION to INTERNAL.
Related violations: <none>
